This is a simple web development technical terms wiki application built using the **MEAN** development stack. The server is built on *Node* courtesy of *ExpressJS*, data is stored in *MongoDB* courtesy of [mongolab](https://mongolab.com), and *AngularJS* on the front-end.

To run the application locally, 
* install [Node](https://nodejs.org/download/) and [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if not already installed on your machine,
* clone the repository. run `git clone https://github.com/smartsdesign/comfy-coder.git`, 
* install all the dependencies. navigate to the root of folder where `package.json` resides, and run `npm install`,
* start the server. run `node ./bin/www`,
* nagivate to **localhost:3000** in the browser.

**That's all**
